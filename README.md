# webixPapaya
Integration Demo using Papaya.js and Webix


#### Getting started

See notes.txt for various web pages I followed for this.  I am using node and webpack
for this, so you need to have nodejs and npm installed.

The basic packages you first need to run this are webpack, webpack-dev-server

This will install webpack, webpack-cli and a dev-server for testing
    npm i webpack --save-dev
    npm i webpack-cli --save-dev
    npm i webpack-dev-server --save-dev
    npm i html-webpack-plugin html-loader --save-dev
